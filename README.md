# Coffee Shop Full Stack

## Full Stack Nano - IAM Final Project

Udacity has decided to open a new digitally enabled cafe for students to order drinks, socialize, and study hard. But they need help setting up their menu experience.

You have been called on to demonstrate your newly learned skills to create a full stack drink menu application. The application must:

1. Display graphics representing the ratios of ingredients in each drink.
2. Allow public users to view drink names and graphics.
3. Allow the shop baristas to see the recipe information.
4. Allow the shop managers to create new drinks and edit existing drinks.

### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains a partially completed Flask server with a pre-written SQLAlchemy module to simplify your data needs. 

[View the README.md within ./backend for more details.](./backend/README.md)

### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains a complete Ionic frontend to consume the data from the Flask server.

[View the README.md within ./frontend for more details.](./frontend/README.md)

### Authors

Jinjin Liang authored the API (`api.py`), authorization handling (`auth.py`), and this README. All other project files, including the models and frontend, were created by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).

## API Reference

### Getting Started

- Base URL: At present this app can only be run locally and is not hosted as a base URL. The backend app is hosted at the default, `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`, which is set as a proxy in the frontend configuration.

## Roles

- Barista
  - can `get:drinks-detail`
- Manager
  - can perform all actions

### Error Handling

Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:

```
{
    "success": False, 
    "error": 400,
    "message": "bad request"
}
```

In general, the API will return two error types when requests fail:

- 404: Resource Not Found
- 422: Not Processable

Furthermore, the API will return the following error when authentication fails:

- 400: invalid claims
- 401: authorization_header_missing

- 401: invalid header
- 401: token expired
- 403: unauthorized
